AIMP Web Control plug-in
========================

What is it
----------

Plug-in for remote control music player [AIMP][] over network.
Provides very wide API support for 3rd party apps over http, provides player control over web-browser and much more!
Minimal supported version of player is 2.6 beta 2 build 485

Why you need it
---------------

Say, you are in an office. You have only one computer which can play music (one with dynamics). In the office, say, 5 employeers. You have AIMP on music-comp, AIMP is playing.. You got phone call - without this plugin you should ask others to stop music, or run yourself to this comp. Having this plug-in you can simply decrease volume, or stop/pause player. Moreover, if you dont like some song, you can simply switch song to another, you can sort songs, can add and remove songs, you can do a lot of things that AIMP can do, except that \*you do it in a web-browser and do it remotely\*!

Technical details
-----------------

 * Written on C++
 * Latest versions of plug-in use [mongoose][] server as web back-end, thanks mongoose!
 * To build plug-in from sources you should have Microsoft C++ compiler and Windows SDK installed, use _build-mscl.bat_. Alternative is to use [mingw][] - crossplatform compiler suite. In that case you should use _build-mingw.sh_
 * Although AIMP is windows-only player, AIMP Web Control can be built on linux system with mingw (use _build-mingw.sh_ for that)

How To Add Authorization
------------------------

 * In directory aimp_web_ctl create file .htpasswd
 * Write to file: vit:mydomain.com:ea91ff01a238d84ffac5f0e709b2c393
 * Authorization is done :)

vit - user name, replace it with yours

mydomain.com - just a sample domain which will be displayed in popup auth dialog, you can leave it as is

ea91ff01a238d84ffac5f0e709b2c393 - md5 from string 'vit:mydomain.com:123456', where 123456 is your password - you can write here your own md5. Good m5 generator is here: <http://www.md5.cz/>
